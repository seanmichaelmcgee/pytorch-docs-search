# PyTorch Documentation Search Tool
## Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** April 15, 2025  
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document outlines the requirements for the PyTorch Documentation Search Tool, a specialized semantic search system designed to help developers find relevant information in PyTorch documentation with a focus on code examples and technical explanations.

### 1.2 Project Overview

The PyTorch Documentation Search Tool is a local, lightweight semantic search system that integrates with Claude Code CLI. It enables developers to quickly find relevant PyTorch documentation, code examples, and technical explanations using natural language queries. The system is designed to understand both natural language descriptions and code patterns, making it particularly effective for technical PyTorch queries.

### 1.3 Scope

In scope:
- Processing and indexing PyTorch documentation files
- Structure-aware parsing of documentation to preserve code examples
- Semantic search capabilities using embeddings
- Integration with Claude Code CLI
- Local, offline operation (except for embedding generation)

Out of scope:
- Web UI or standalone application interface
- Real-time documentation updates
- Multi-language support beyond Python/PyTorch
- Cloud-based hosting or deployment

## 2. Product Vision

### 2.1 Problem Statement

PyTorch documentation is extensive and distributed across various sources (official docs, tutorials, guides, etc.). Developers frequently need to:
- Find specific code examples for implementation tasks
- Understand API usage patterns
- Access technical explanations of PyTorch concepts

Current search solutions often:
- Break up code examples, making them hard to understand
- Return imprecise results for technical queries
- Fail to distinguish between code and explanatory text
- Require online access to documentation sites

### 2.2 Target Users

- PyTorch developers working on implementation tasks
- Data scientists using PyTorch for machine learning projects
- AI researchers experimenting with custom neural network architectures
- Claude Code CLI users working on PyTorch projects

### 2.3 Value Proposition

The PyTorch Documentation Search Tool will:
- Save development time by providing precise, relevant search results
- Improve code quality by helping developers find proper implementation examples
- Enhance understanding of PyTorch concepts through targeted access to explanations
- Function locally, enabling offline work
- Provide code-aware search that understands both natural language and code patterns

## 3. User Requirements

### 3.1 User Personas

#### Persona 1: Alex - ML Engineer
- Uses PyTorch daily for implementing models
- Needs to find specific implementation patterns quickly
- Often works with custom layers and loss functions
- Frequently references PyTorch documentation

#### Persona 2: Taylor - Data Scientist
- Uses PyTorch for specific projects
- Less familiar with PyTorch API details
- Needs explanatory content and examples
- Prefers natural language queries

#### Persona 3: Jordan - AI Researcher
- Develops experimental architectures
- Needs to understand PyTorch internals
- Often searches for specific PyTorch functionality
- Requires detailed technical information

### 3.2 User Stories

1. As a PyTorch developer, I want to find code examples for implementing custom autograd functions so I can optimize my model's backward pass.

2. As a data scientist, I want to search for explanations of PyTorch concepts using natural language so I can better understand the framework.

3. As an AI researcher, I want to find implementation details of specific PyTorch classes so I can extend them for my research.

4. As a Claude Code user, I want to seamlessly access PyTorch documentation while chatting with Claude so I can implement solutions without switching contexts.

5. As a developer working offline, I want to search PyTorch documentation locally so I can be productive without internet access.

6. As a PyTorch user, I want search results that distinguish between code examples and explanatory text so I can find the information type I need.

### 3.3 User Experience Goals

- Search queries should return results in under 2 seconds
