## 📝 Notes

- The environment.yml file is now configured to avoid dependency conflicts
- NumPy has been downgraded to 1.26.4 to avoid compatibility issues
- chromadb is now installed via pip rather than conda
- Werkzeug is explicitly pinned to ensure Flask compatibility
- The Conda environment is now strongly recommended over venv
- The setup script provides validation and user-friendly feedback
- Future package updates should be carefully tested for compatibility
