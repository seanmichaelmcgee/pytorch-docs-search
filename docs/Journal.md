### April 15, 2025 - Initial Project Setup

#### Work Completed
- Set up project structure with required directories
- Created initial implementation plan and requirements document
- Set up Python virtual environment
- Installed core dependencies:
  - OpenAI API client for embeddings
  - Tree-sitter for code-aware parsing
  - ChromaDB for vector database
  - Testing and development utilities
- Created configuration infrastructure with environment variables
- Implemented document parsing using Tree-sitter
- Developed code-aware document chunking
- Created embedding generation module
- Implemented ChromaDB integration
- Developed search interface with query processor and result formatter

#### Challenges Encountered
- Tree-sitter-languages version compatibility issues
- Package dependencies for Ubuntu 24.04
- Getting the chunking strategy right to preserve code structure
- Balancing chunk size for text vs. code content

#### Solutions Implemented
- Updated to latest compatible tree-sitter-languages version
- Implemented specialized chunking strategies:
  - Function/class-aware chunking for code
  - Paragraph-based chunking for text
  - Fallback to sentence and word boundaries when needed
- Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff for API calls
- Added type detection for queries to prioritize code vs text results

#### Next Steps
- Set up Claude Code integration
- Create end-to-end tests
- Develop monitoring and maintenance scripts
- Document API and usage

#### Notes
- Need to verify OpenAI API access with actual keys
- Consider extending to add PyTorch-specific keyword recognition
- Investigate potential extension to other ML framework documentation
