### April 15, 2025 - Initial Project Setup

#### Work Completed
- Set up project structure with required directories
- Created initial implementation plan and requirements document
- Set up Python virtual environment
- Installed core dependencies:
  - OpenAI API client for embeddings
  - Tree-sitter for code-aware parsing
  - ChromaDB for vector database
  - Testing and development utilities
- Created configuration infrastructure with environment variables
- Implemented document parsing using Tree-sitter
- Developed code-aware document chunking
- Created embedding generation module
- Implemented ChromaDB integration
- Developed search interface with query processor and result formatter

#### Challenges Encountered
- Tree-sitter-languages version compatibility issues
- Package dependencies for Ubuntu 24.04
- Getting the chunking strategy right to preserve code structure
- Balancing chunk size for text vs. code content

#### Solutions Implemented
- Updated to latest compatible tree-sitter-languages version
- Implemented specialized chunking strategies:
  - Function/class-aware chunking for code
  - Paragraph-based chunking for text
  - Fallback to sentence and word boundaries when needed
- Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff for API calls
- Added type detection for queries to prioritize code vs text results

#### Next Steps
- Set up Claude Code integration
- Create end-to-end tests
- Develop monitoring and maintenance scripts
- Document API and usage

#### Notes
- Need to verify OpenAI API access with actual keys
- Consider extending to add PyTorch-specific keyword recognition
- Investigate potential extension to other ML framework documentation

### April 15, 2025 - Embedding Model Upgrade

#### Work Completed
- Updated system to use text-embedding-3-large model instead of text-embedding-ada-002
- Implemented embedding cache system to improve performance and reduce API costs
- Created migration script for updating existing embeddings
- Added benchmarking tools to measure embedding quality
- Optimized ChromaDB configuration for larger vector dimensions (3072 vs 1536)
- Updated query processor to work with enhanced model
- Added memory efficiency measures for larger vector operations

#### Challenges Encountered
- Memory management with larger embedding vectors
- API rate limits during batch operations
- Storage requirements for caching large embeddings
- Maintaining backward compatibility with existing embeddings

#### Solutions Implemented
- Reduced embedding batch sizes from 20 to 10 for memory efficiency
- Added progressive chunking with garbage collection to manage memory
- Implemented LRU caching strategy with configurable maximum size
- Created optimized HNSW index settings for ChromaDB
- Added embedding dimensionality verification to prevent errors
- Enhanced retry logic with more aggressive backoff for API calls

#### Next Steps
- Evaluate performance improvements from the enhanced model
- Complete Claude Code integration
- Create extended test suite for the improved system
- Document upgraded architecture and configuration

#### Notes
- Early testing shows improved semantic understanding for code queries
- Cache hit rates should improve over time as more queries are processed
- Consider investigating quantization for storage efficiency
